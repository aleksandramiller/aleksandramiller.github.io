                <div class="h-50"></div>
                <p>I have always had a great passion for stories. I loved listening, reading, and telling them. This passion brought me initially to journalism; however, with time, I realized that my love for storytelling is greater and I decided to explore different venues of storytelling such as graphics, videos, and social media, which enabled me to start my digital marketing journey. </p>
                <p>I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Marketing at the University of Cincinnati. I work as a digital marketing specialist, where I have helped increase brand awareness of the service-learning program. Pursuing a career as a Digital Marketer will give me an opportunity to develop an effective marketing strategy to improve brand awareness, website traffic, and conversions. </p>
                <p>I am a metric-driven problem-solver with an eye for creativity who embraces change as an exciting challenge for learning and growth. I consider myself a self-starter with excellent organizational skills, and attention to detail that thrives in a fast-paced, multi-project fluid environment.</p>
